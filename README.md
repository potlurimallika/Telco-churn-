Churn occurs when someone chooses to stop using a business's services. Companies are constantly analyzing this phenomenon, as it helps them understand customers who could leave their services.
This project aims to train a machine-learning model using existing Telco phoning company data. This model will predict with a high degree of accuracy which customers will likely churn. 
The results of this prediction will help Telcon owners make effective decisions.
It's crucial to identify and retain potentially churning customers. We can maximise Telco's future profit by giving relevant, personalised discounts through feature engineering. This is a task of utmost importance and urgency.
Calculate churn probability and know whether Telco customers will be churned or not.
By contacting the top 20% of churn customers, we can increase retention rates and provide discounts based on base profit, positively impacting long-term revenue.
The insights provided by our model also enable company to allocate resources more effectively and optimise operational strategies, such as adjusting marketing efforts or improving customer service, to reduce churn rates. 
Offering discounts can reduce the profit margin per customer. However, this can be offset by the increased lifetime value of a loyal customer. 
Redirecting customers to more appropriate pricing tiers can help retain them without significantly impacting overall revenue. 
Retaining our existing customers is not just about numbers; it's about building loyalty and trust. 
This translates into 'more customers and more references', providing resilience in a crisis and serving as an organic growth strategy.
A 5% increase in customer retention can boost profits by 25%
